(optional: create the README.md file)

2) To copy the repository we must get the SSH from Github.com -> and use the command "git clone <SSH here>"

3) the default name is "origin git@github.com:minty-mango/Odin-Project-Mango.git"

4) The name origin is the name of my remote connection. In this case we can specify which remote conneciton
we want to push this too.

5) "Main" in this case is which branch we want to make the changes to. In this case we only have the main branch
called "main" so we push it to there.

6) The two stages are: the staging area which can be like the waiting area for files to be committed to the main
and the commit stage where we finally commit the changes or like taking the photo.

7) git status

8) git add <file name> or . for everything

9) git commit -m "Message here."

10) git push main or git push or git push origin main
